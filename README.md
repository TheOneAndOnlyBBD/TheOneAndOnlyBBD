Hi there, as the name implies (and to my current knowledge) I AM the one and only BBD. No, I'm sure I am not, but anyway...
<br>
Generally-speaking, I'm one of those strange people who are technically a nerd/geek, but only with regards to a few select areas,
as opposed to more generalized, polymath levels of knowledge.
<br>
As a Programmer/Coder, I suppose my interests can almost be separated down the middle. Generally-speaking, I love to tinker and figure stuff out. 
Lately - as in the last couple of years - I've been branching out a little into the use of peripherals such as Arduino modules 
and utilizing the Raspberry Pi GPIO line/rail to interface with devices. Likewise, I love learning how to write code that allows for the
actual interfacing and sending/receiving data to and from external devices. 
<br>
I enjoy the process of getting - digitally at least - into the mechanics of what is going on and learning how to interact and utilize the hardware for my own needs.
<br>
Strictly in terms of coding, my strongest/preferred areas are Network Communication, Transport Protocols, Memory Interaction and generally low-level stuff.
<br>
Nowadays, my main goto Programming Languages are C and C++. However, over the years - and even today, if necessary - I have dabbled with Python, HTML, some batch coding and 
bash scripting and C# as well as Xamarin. Lately I've also been (trying) to learn more about Assembly and play around with that. Generally-speaking, I'm one of those Programmers/Coders 
who knows little bits and pieces from a lot of areas.
<br>
I don't feel qualified to call myself a hacker, but I suppose in the oldest understanding and sense of the term, to a large degree I AM.
<br>
My general approach to project development is;
<br>
1: Research and gain the information I will need in order to achieve my goal (and/or the goal of my application).<br>
2: Write the code and/or - if necessary - research, learn and implement techniques and functionality that are new to me.<br>
3: If the first attempt doesn't work, develop a different/alternative method based on the core mechanics of what is needed. Keep trying, altering and refining the process until it works.<br>
4: Test the application, observe the results and refine the code.<br>
5: Keep on testing and refining until it's about as then-currently perfect as it can be.<br>
<br>
I tend to struggle with enjoying the 'small wins'. The closest I come to enjoyment is relief, and then shortly thereafter,<br>I'm thinking about and researching ways to refine the code and make it smaller, tidier and easier
to follow.
