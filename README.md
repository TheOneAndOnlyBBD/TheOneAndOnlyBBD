Hi there, as the name implies (and to my current knowledge) I AM the one and only BBD. No, I'm sure I am not, but anyway...
<br><br>
Generally-speaking, I'm one of those strange people who are technically a nerd/geek, but only with regards to a few select areas,<br>
as opposed to more generalized, polymath levels of knowledge.
<br>
<p>As a Programmer/Coder, I suppose my interests can almost be separated down the middle. Generally-speaking, I love to tinker and figure stuff out.
Lately - as in the last couple of years - I've been branching out a little into the use of peripherals such as Arduino modules
and utilizing the Raspberry Pi GPIO line/rail to interface with devices. Likewise, I love learning how to write code that allows for the
actual interfacing and sending/receiving data to and from external devices. I enjoy the process of getting - digitally at least - into the mechanics of 
what is going on and learning how to interact and utilize the hardware for my own needs.</p> 
<br>
Strictly in terms of coding, my strongest/preferred areas are Network Communication, Transport Protocols, Memory Interaction and generally low-level stuff.
<br>
<br>
<p>
Nowadays, my main goto Programming Languages are C and C++. However, over the years - and even today, if necessary - I have dabbled with Python, HTML, some batch coding and bash scripting and C# as well as Xamarin.
Lately I've also been (trying) to learn more about Assembly and play around with that. Generally-speaking, I'm one of those Programmers/Coders who knows little bits and pieces from a lot of areas.<br><br>
